## Presentation
Did you ever ask yourself how does the world works : from the mouvement of fluids and waves, to a basket ball trajectory, through the formation of galaxies and our own Solar System. On this Website, my goal is to explain to you some physics concepts of the everyday world, to describe them through mathematics equations of several difficulty levels, then to construct some visualisations to better understand theses abstract ideas.
